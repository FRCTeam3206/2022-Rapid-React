This project requires VictorSPX and ControlMode from the com.ctre.phoenix packages. These are included with WPILib-VSCode, but MUST be explicitly added to the vendordeps folder (the folder this file sits in)

To do this:
	1- Press the Ctrl+Shift+P keybind in WPILib-VSCode
	2- Type "Manage Vendor Libraries"
	3- Click "Install New Libraries (offline)"
	4- Select the phoenix library
	5- Run "gradlew build" and reload the window (Ctrl+Shift+P, type "reload"), or click the popup VSCode provides

If you don't do this, VSCode won't recognize the libraries even though they're installed and gradlew builds will fail
